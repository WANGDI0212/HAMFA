Hypoxia associated molecular feature analysis
1. Performed multiple analyses to validate the performance and assess the robustness of this hypoxia signature.
2. Rigorous classification of hypoxia status by an established gene expression signature 
3. Identified global patterns of multidimensional hypoxia-associated molecular signatures across cancer types
