Hypoxia associated molecular feature analysis
1.	Scripts to validate the performance and the robustness of the hypoxia signature.
2.	Rigorous classification of hypoxia status by an established gene expression signature
3.	Identification of multidimensional hypoxia-associated molecular signatures across cancer types
	3.1 Hypoxia associated mRNA features
	3.2 Hypoxia associated methylation features
	3.3 Identified hypoxia associated mutation
	3.4 Identified hypoxia associated protein
	3.5 Identified hypoxia associated miRNAs
	3.6 Identified hypoxia associated DNA copy number alteration (CNA)
4.	Analysis of hypoxia associated features and drug response
	4.1	The Spearman correlation between hypoxia associated gene expression and the drug response data from Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC)
	4.2	 The Spearman’s correlation between hypoxia score and imputed drug response from a previous study (Geeleher, P. et al. Genome Res. 27, 1743–1751 (2017)) in TCGA patients.
